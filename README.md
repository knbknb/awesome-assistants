A list of assistants that leverage AI to help me with my daily tasks.
List is used to build packages for different languages for easy integration.

## Files

- `.yml` - [assistants.yml](assistants.yml)  for the full list.
- `.sh`, `.py` - various scripts for the ongoing effort to reorder + cluster the assistants.

## Work in progress

The assistants.yml file is called by shellscript `find-persona.sh` in my repo [perplexity-api-search](https://github.com/knbknb/perplexity-api-search).
