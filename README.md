# Awesome assistants

> A curated list of awesome AI assistants  

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

A list of "custom user instructions" to be sent to Chat-AI-systems, along with the actual prompt.

The "assistants definitions" are one-paragraph statements, for various roles, professions and personas.  
In the future, this might help me with my prompting.

## Work in progress

This repo as such has no real use yet, and no actual value.  
The `assistants.yml` file gets fetched by shellscript `find-assistant.sh` from my repo [perplexity-api-search](https://github.com/knbknb/perplexity-api-search).

## Files

- `.yml`, `.yaml` - [assistants.yml](assistants.yml)  for the full list.
- `.sh`, `.py` - various scripts for the ongoing effort to reorder + cluster the assistants.
