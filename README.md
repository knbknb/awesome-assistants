# Awesome assistants

> A curated list of awesome AI assistants

A list of "custom user instructions" to be sent to Chat-AI-systems, along with the actual prompt.

The "assistants definitions" are one-paragraph statements, for various roles, professions and personas.  
In the future, this might help me with my prompting.

## Work in progress

`OBSOLETE` - For now, I have stopped using this. I prefer shorter prompts in my repo [ai-system-personas](https://github.com/knbknb/ai-system-personas/)

This repo as such has no real use yet, and has no actual value.  Maybe I pick it up again later.
The `assistants.yml` file gets fetched by shellscript `find-assistant.sh` from my repo [perplexity-api-search](https://github.com/knbknb/perplexity-api-search).

## Files

- `.yml`, `.yaml` - [assistants.yml](assistants.yml)  for the full list.
- `.sh`, `.py` - various scripts for the ongoing effort to reorder + cluster the assistants.
